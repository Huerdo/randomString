randomString
============
Simple string generator based on an Array of characters.
There is a simple stepper to modify the number of characters of the string from 1 to 30. The initial value of the stepper is 10.
To change this edit:
```objective-c
        stepper.value = 10
        stepper.minimumValue = 1
        stepper.maximumValue = 30
```
